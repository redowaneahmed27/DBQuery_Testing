# DBQueryTesting

Welcome to the **DBQueryTesting** repository, a comprehensive resource dedicated to database testing. This repository is essential for ensuring the integrity and performance of databases throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

Database testing is a crucial aspect of the SDLC as it verifies the reliability, security, and performance of database systems. Key aspects include ensuring data integrity, optimizing performance, verifying security, validating functionality, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and standards. This repository covers various database testing scenarios using applications like XAMPP, SQLyog, DBeaver, and PostgreSQL.

## Why Database Testing is Important in SDLC

- **Data Accuracy and Consistency**: Ensures that the data remains accurate, consistent, and reliable across different operations.
- **Performance Optimization**: Identifies and resolves performance bottlenecks to ensure efficient database operations.
- **Security Verification**: Verifies that the database is secure from unauthorized access and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Functionality Validation**: Ensures that all database operations work as expected and meet functional requirements.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures compliance with relevant regulations and industry standards.

## Applications Used

- **XAMPP**: A free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package.
- **SQLyog**: A powerful GUI tool for RDBMS, used for database management and development.
- **DBeaver**: A versatile multi-platform database tool for developers, database administrators, analysts, and users.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust, open-source object-relational database system.

## Database Query Assignment

In this assignment, several key operations were performed:

- Created a database named `database_assignment`.
- Created a table `customers` with fields for customer information.
- Inserted sample data into the `customers` table.
- Queried the database to display all databases and the `customers` table.
- Selected customers with points greater than 1000, limited to 2 results.
- Found customers born between 1980 and 1990 or with points less than 1000.
- Searched for customers with 'burgh' in their name using a regular expression.
- Identified customers without a phone number.
- Counted the number of customers by state.
- Identified the customer with the maximum points.
- Assigned member designations (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) based on point ranges.
